## Notice
The app is now discontinued and it won't get any further updates (at least for a very long time). It started to be a burden on me and I was afraid that it would affect my daily and school life so I decided to discontinuing SocialSpace. Anyone wants to use or improve my codes can borrow them. That's it. Thanks for all the support.
